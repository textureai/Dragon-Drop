Dragon Drop allows you to generate/regenerate key pairs or mnemonics using one or more arbitrary files + optional password as entropy. 

NOTE:
No security testing has been done. 
No testing at all has been done other than confirming it generates the same keys with the same file + password combos. (Like twice)
Use at your own risk. Don't use if you don't know what you're doing and the associated risks.
